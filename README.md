# Email Signature Generator
##### Note: This project was used purely for EnactusHacks internal use. Feel free to modify if you wish.

## Get Started
I have created a python script to inject your name, email, etc. directly into the html file so you don't have to do anything.

### Clone The Repo

    git clone https://github.com/jeffstjean/email-signature-generator.git
    cd email-signature-generator

### Update Personal Information
Use your favourite text editor to update your personal information in the variables.env file.
    nano variables.env

### Build

    python build.py

A signature.html file will be generated. Use this for the next step.

## Embed Into Email Client
Depending on your mail client, there will be different steps that need to be followed to properly install on your client. Follow the steps on [this link.](https://www.mail-signatures.com/guide-with-images/)
